# Visions AI - Generative Web Designer 🧠🎨

> A Next-Gen "text-to-website" engine that functions like a digital architect, not just a template switcher.

**Visions AI** is a browser-based generative tool that constructs unique, high-quality landing pages based on natural language prompts. It uses a custom **Design DNA Algorithm** to determine color psychology, typography, shapes, and layout dynamics in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The "Architect" Engine (Visions Engine 2.0)
Unlike standard builders that use fixed templates, Visions AI analyzes your prompt's sentiment and keywords to decide:
- **Vibe:** Cyberpunk, Luxury, Organic, Corporate, or Creative.
- **shapes:** Sharp edges for tech, Pill-shapes for creative, Rounded for friendly.
- **Layout:** Center-focused for bold statements, Split-screen for SaaS.

### 2. Procedural CSS Art (No Images? No Problem) 🎨
The **Geometry Engine** generates assets on the fly using pure CSS:
- **Glowing Orbs & Mesh Gradients** for creative vibes.
- **Cyber Grids & Neon Lines** for tech vibes.
- **Frost Glass Effects** for modern UI.

### 3. Smart Asset Injection 🖼️
If specific keywords are detected (e.g., "Gaming", "Coffee", "Gym"), the engine intelligently injects high-quality 3D assets to match the context.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling:** CSS3 (Variables, Animations, Grid/Flexbox)
- **Architecture:** Component-based procedural generation.
